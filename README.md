# NŊOB Universe — HTML Prototype Archive

This repository contains approximately 310 standalone HTML files created over time as
experiments, prototypes, and working demonstrations.

The files include:
- Interactive HTML/JS canvases
- Visual simulations
- Pattern-recognition tools
- Intuition, sales, and decision-environment experiments
- System thinking and coordination demos
- Early-stage UI/UX and logic explorations

These files were developed incrementally and are not yet consolidated into a single product.
They represent a **functional archive of ideas**, not a finished application.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:
1. Identify recurring technical and conceptual patterns
2. Group files into reusable functional modules
3. Extract latent systems and toolkits
4. Propose viable next-stage developments built on existing code

The goal is **synthesis, not cleanup**.
Experimental value should be preserved.

## Constraints

- Do NOT rewrite or refactor files wholesale
- Do NOT assume missing context is an error
- Treat the codebase as a prototype archive, not technical debt

## Desired Outcomes

- A pattern inventory of reusable components
- Identification of common logic structures
- Suggestions for modularisation
- Proposals for future products, tools, or platforms
