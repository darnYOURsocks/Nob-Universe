  "abstract": "Captured current AFM field state showing attractor count, field strength, and stability of the map.",

  "description": "Snapshot captured immediately after the latest Attractor Field Mapping (AFM) run. The result confirms a stable field with no bifurcations and balanced attractor distribution across the observed manifold. This entry tracks the raw metrics for downstream visualization and QA.",

  "results": {
    "source": "Attractor Field Mapping (AFM) engine",
    "totalAttractors": 4,
    "fieldStrength": 1.2,

    "trajectoryPreview": [
      "truncated: preview vector list captured in AFM session log",
      "use AFM visualizer export if full trajectory reconstruction is needed"
    ]
  },

  "notes": [
    "No bifurcations detected; topology remains consistent with prior stable runs.",
    "Field strength calibrated to 1.2 to balance attractor symmetry before visualization export."
